# Recommender-System
Two implementations of collaborative filtering recommender systems.
1. Low-rank matrix factorization written using Numpy which implements stochastic gradient descent with the bold driver algorithm and Nesterov optimizer.
2. Tensorflow implementation of the auto-encoder recommender system described in "AutoRec: Autoencoders Meet Collaborative Filtering" by Suvash Sedhain, Aditya Krishna Menon, Scott Sanner and Lexing Xie.
